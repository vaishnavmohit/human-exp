The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

This is an archived copy of the original README. The current project README and documentation live under `docs/` and the root `README.md`.

Legacy notes:
- Keep this file for historical reference.
- Use `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` and `docs/QUICK_START.md` for current setup and deployment instructions.
